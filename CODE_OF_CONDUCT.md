## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. The goal of our program is to foster 
supportive mentorship, personal development, and lasting connection between peers. 

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but 
it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few 
ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, 
mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Django project or Django 
Software Foundation. This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, DSF events, 
and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. 
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to 
participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by 
emailing conduct@djangoproject.com. For more details please see our Reporting Guidelines
